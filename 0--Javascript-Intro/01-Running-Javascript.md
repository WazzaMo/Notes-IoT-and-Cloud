# Running Javascript Code

## Browsers
Almost every browser has a javascript console where
you can see javascript errors on a webpage but also
try javascript code, live, before adding it to a file.

How you access the javascript console is different
on each browser and in each operating system.

### Firefox and Chrome Browsers
The JavaScript console is called WebConsole in Firefox.
In Chrome, the JavaScript console is part of the Developer Tools.

| Operating System | How to Open   |
|------------------|---------------|
| Windows          | CTRL-SHIFT-I  |
| MacOs            | CMD-Options-I |

Note: That's a capital letter I (as in big 'i') and not a 1.

### Test that JavaScript Works
With the JavaScript console open, type the following command 
and press ENTER to confirm that you have the correct window:

```javascript
console.log("Hello There")
```

## Node JS
Start a Terminal Window (BASH on Linux or Mac / PowerShell on Windows)
and type the following to see if NodeJS is installed and its
version.

```bash
node --version
```

If you get an error message, NodeJS is *not* installed and
you should download it from [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
