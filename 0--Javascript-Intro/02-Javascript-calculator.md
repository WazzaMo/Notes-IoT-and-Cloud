# Introduction to Javascript
## Javascript as a Calculator
Every web browser has javascript and javascript can be
used as a calculator, so from now on, you won't need a calculator as long as you have a browser.

Open a browser and find the javascript console
- in Safari (Mac) it's called the "Error Console"
- in Chrome it's called the "Console" in 'Developer Tools'
- in Firefox it's called the "Web Console" in 'Web Developer'

## Operations
The console will calculate values when entered directly.

| Operation | Javascript Uses| Example |
|---|---|---|
| Add | `+` | 3 + 5 = 8 |
| Subtract | `-` | 5 - 3 = 2 |
| Multiply | `*` | 7 * 2 = 14 |
| Divide | `/` | 10 / 5 = 2|
| to-power-of | `**` | 3 ** 2 = 9 |
| Remainder | `%` | 5 % 2 = 1 |

Brackets work as well.
`(2 + 3) * 2 = 10`
