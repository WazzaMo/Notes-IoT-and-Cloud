# Setup - Environment

## Arduino IDE
If you haven't already download the Arduino IDE.
The best place to get it is the Arduino Website.

## Visual Studio Code
VS Code runs on Mac, Windows and Linux and is
the editor I will use.

## Node JS
I installed NodeJS v 10.x - the latest.
The nodejs website gives you two choices:
- 8.x LTS
- 10.x Latest

LTS means long term support and it is meant for building servers and systems that need to be in production for a long time.

The "latest" edition has the newer features but will see more releases and updates over time and it keeps marching forward. Eventually, the LTS edition gets updated to a stable version from the "latest" edition but it's always a couple of versions behind because the older versions have proven themselves.
