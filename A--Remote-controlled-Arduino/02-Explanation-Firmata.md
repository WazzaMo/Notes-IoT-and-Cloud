# Firmata - Laptop -> Arduino

## Term: Protocol
A Protocol is a language for communicating between two different machines over a serial link (USB cable) or a network (e.g., the Internet).

As an example, when you see HTTP on your web browser, that means the `H`yper `T`ext `T`ransfer `P`rotocol and so HTTP is the protocol, or language, that a browser uses to ask an internet server for a web page.

## What is Firmata?
Firmata is a protocol for communicating between a computer and a robotics device, like an Arduino. 

The Firmata project also provides standard firmwares to install on robotics devices that have the firmata.

We're going to install Firmata on our Arduino boards or SparkFun Blynk boards. Then we will control it remotely (over USB serial) from a laptop.

## Internet of Things
To start with, our laptop and the Arduino board will be working together in our project to be an IoT project. The laptop is providing the brains and the Arduino board is giving us connections to sensors and motors - the body.

Later, in the semester, we will replace the Laptop and Arduino combination with a Raspberry Pi because it is powerful enough to do both jobs.
