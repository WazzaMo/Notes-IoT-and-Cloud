# Notes on IoT and Cloud Services

## Monash University
This is part of a Masters Degree in Monash Arts Design and Architecture in Caulfield.

## Motivation
The notes and course looks to develop skills and understanding about new industrial applications for Internet of Things and how they play a role in Cloud enabled services.

## Scale
Using Arduino projects, controlled by a laptop or computer, is a small-scale model of what it's like to have Cloud based software working with devices at the edge.

These concepts are discussed more fully in class.

Later, students build applications using Google Cloud services in Firebase and then integrate with Raspberry Pi 3 devices at the edge.
