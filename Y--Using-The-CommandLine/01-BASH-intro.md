# Bourne Again SHell (BASH)
## Where do You Find BASH?
The BASH shell or bash, is found in
GNU Linux environments and now in MacOS.

If you use Windows and download 
Git for Windows, it will also
come with a bash environment that runs in Windows.

## What is Wrong with Visual Tools?
Mouse click... mouse drag... double-click...
How can you automate these steps?
Can you simple make these steps repeatable?
Is every visual environment the same?
Every desktop and icon arrangement the same?

No... of course not.

So visual environments with icons, mouse clicks, touch screens and gestures do not
make for regular, robust and repeatable
steps that can be written down and performed
by others.

## Why is BASH Important?
BASH uses simple commands to describe
actions that can create, edit or delete
 files or directories and run programs.

You can write bash commands in a text file
with .sh extension and execute that like
a program on Linux or MacOS so that makes
it even easier to make tasks easily repeatable.
